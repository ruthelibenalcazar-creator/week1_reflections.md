# Week 1 Reflections – Data Structures

This week, I learned the basics of data structures and why they are important in programming.
Data structures help organize data efficiently so programs can run faster and be easier to manage.

So far, we have discussed concepts like arrays and how data is stored in memory.
I also learned that choosing the right data structure can improve performance and make code easier to understand.

I am excited to continue learning about more complex structures like lists, stacks, and queues.
